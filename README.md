## 🔍 Abstract

Human image animation has attracted increasing attention and developed rapidly due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits generalization and discards essential 3D information.  
To tackle these problems, we propose **MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video Crafter)**, the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences for open-world human image animation beyond intermediate 2D representations.

- We introduce **4DMoT (4D motion tokenizer)** to encode raw motion data into discrete motion tokens, preserving 4D compact yet expressive spatio-temporal information.
- Then, we propose **MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT)**, which integrates a motion attention module and 4D positional encodings to effectively modulate vision tokens with motion tokens.
- The overall pipeline facilitates high-quality human video generation guided by 4D motion tokens.

MTVCrafter achieves **state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98**, outperforming the second-best by approximately **65%**. It generalizes well to diverse characters (single/multiple, full/half-body) across various styles.

## 🎯 Motivation

![Motivation](./static/images/Motivation.png)

Our motivation is that directly tokenizing 4D motion captures more faithful and expressive information than traditional 2D-rendered pose images derived from the driven video.

## 💡 Method

![Method](./static/images/4DMoT.png)

*(1) 4DMoT*:
Our 4D motion tokenizer consists of an encoder-decoder framework to learn spatio-temporal latent representations of SMPL motion sequences,
and a vector quantizer to learn discrete tokens in a unified space.
All operations are performed in 2D space along frame and joint axes.

![Method](./static/images/MV-DiT.png)

*(2) MV-DiT*:
Based on video DiT architecture,
we design a 4D motion attention module to combine motion tokens with vision tokens.
Since the tokenization and flattening disrupted positional information,
we introduce 4D RoPE to recover the spatio-temporal relationships.
To further improve the quality of generation and generalization,
we use learnable unconditional tokens for motion classifier-free guidance.

## 🛠️ Installation

We recommend using a clean Python environment (Python 3.10+).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MTVCrafter.git
cd MTVCrafter

# Create virtual environment
conda create -n mtvcrafter python=3.11
conda activate mtvcrafter

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For models regarding:

1. **NLF-Pose Estimator**  
   Download [`nlf_l_multi.torchscript`](https://github.com/isarandi/nlf/releases) from the NLF release page.

2. **MV-DiT Backbone Models**  
   - **CogVideoX**: Download the [CogVideoX-5B checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-5b).  
   - **Wan-2-1**: Download the [Wan-2-1-14B checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/alibaba-pai/Wan2.1-Fun-V1.1-14B-InP) and place it under the `wan2.1/` folder.

3. **MTVCrafter Checkpoints**  
   Download the MV-DiT and 4DMoT checkpoints from [MTVCrafter on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/yanboding/MTVCrafter).

4. *(Optional)*
   Download the enhanced LoRA for better performance of Wan2.1_I2V_14B:  
   [`Wan2.1_I2V_14B_FusionX_LoRA.safetensors`](https://huggingface.co/vrgamedevgirl84/Wan14BT2VFusioniX/blob/main/FusionX_LoRa/Wan2.1_I2V_14B_FusionX_LoRA.safetensors)  
   Place it under the `wan2.1/` folder.
   
   Note that this LoRA is used to improve the inference speed and the details of generated video, but may occur worse motion accuracy.

## 🚀 Usage

To animate a human image with a given 3D motion sequence,  
you first need to prepare SMPL motion-video pairs. You can either:

- Use the provided sample data: `data/sampled_data.pkl`, or  
- Extract SMPL motion sequences from your own driving video using:

```bash
python process_nlf.py "your_video_directory"
```

This will generate a motion-video `.pkl` file under `"your_video_directory"`.

#### ▶️ Inference of MV-DiT-7B
```bash
python infer_7b.py \
    --ref_image_path "ref_images/human.png" \
    --motion_data_path "data/sampled_data.pkl" \
    --output_path "inference_output"
```

#### ▶️ Inference of MV-DiT-17B (with text control)
```bash
python infer_17b.py \
    --ref_image_path "ref_images/woman.png" \
    --motion_data_path "data/sampled_data.pkl" \
    --output_path "inference_output" \
    --prompt "The woman is dancing on the beach, waves, sunset."
```

**Arguments:**

- `--ref_image_path`: Path to the reference character image.
- `--motion_data_path`: Path to the SMPL motion sequence (.pkl format).
- `--output_path`: Directory to save the generated video.
- `--prompt` (optional): Text prompt describing the scene or style.
